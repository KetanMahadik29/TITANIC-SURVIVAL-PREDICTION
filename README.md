# TITANIC-SURVIVAL-PREDICTION

This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and more.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers. Key features include:
- **Survived**: Target variable (1 = survived, 0 = did not survive)
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Passenger's age
- **Fare**: Ticket fare
- **Embarked**: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Modeling Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature encoding (e.g., converting categorical data into numerical form)
   - Normalization and scaling

2. **Model Building**:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Gradient Boosting
   - Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
